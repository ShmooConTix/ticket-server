# ShmooCon Ticket Bot Mock Ticket Server ðŸŽ«ðŸ¤–
*This is part of a proof-of-concept bot to automatically purchase tickets for ShmooCon, a conference that is notoriously hard to get tickets for. [See more info here.](https://github.com/ShmooConTix/ticket-bot)*

## About / Features
This serves as the "mock server" for the bot to ensure that we didn't use the *actual* ShmooCon ticket servers, as that would be unwanted in a PoC / experiment. It is built with Bun, Elysia, SQLite, and React.

- Accurate replication of the ShmooCon ticket purchasing process
- Documentation through [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)
- Cookie validation to ensure that the bot went through correctly (stored w/ SQLite)
- Extensive logging

## Installation
To run a development environment, you can run the API through the `Dockerfile`. Make sure you expose the necessary ports. If you aren't familiar with Docker, please consult the documentation.

## Contributing
This project / experiment is over and is not open to changes. Please contact me if you have questions.
